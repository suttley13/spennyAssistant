# Spenny Assistant Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for enhancing the Spenny Assistant application with data persistence, deployment, and GitHub integration.

## Phase 1: Data Persistence with Firebase Firestore

### Step 1: Verify Current localStorage Implementation
- [x] Check the existing `storage.ts` service
- [x] Create a utility to test localStorage functionality
- [x] Expose the test utility in the browser console

### Step 2: Set Up Firebase Configuration
- [x] Create Firebase configuration file
- [x] Add Firebase dependencies to package.json
- [x] Create environment variables for Firebase configuration
- [x] Implement conditional Firebase initialization

### Step 3: Implement Firestore Data Service
- [x] Create a Firestore data service with the same interface as localStorage
- [x] Implement CRUD operations for tasks, projects, features, and shipped items
- [x] Add fallback to localStorage when Firebase is not available

### Step 4: Update Context to Use Firebase
- [x] Modify TaskContext to support both storage options
- [x] Add storage mode toggle functionality
- [x] Implement loading state for async operations
- [x] Ensure data is always backed up to localStorage

### Step 5: Create UI for Storage Toggle
- [x] Create StorageToggle component
- [x] Add the component to the application header
- [x] Style the component to match the application design

### Step 6: Testing and Debugging
- [ ] Test localStorage functionality
- [ ] Test Firebase functionality
- [ ] Test switching between storage modes
- [ ] Fix any bugs or issues

## Phase 2: Deployment with Firebase Hosting

### Step 1: Set Up Firebase Hosting Configuration
- [x] Create firebase.json configuration file
- [x] Create .firebaserc file
- [x] Set up Firestore security rules
- [x] Configure Firestore indexes

### Step 2: Build and Deploy Process
- [x] Update README with deployment instructions
- [ ] Test the build process locally
- [ ] Deploy to Firebase Hosting manually
- [ ] Verify the deployed application

### Step 3: Set Up Continuous Deployment
- [x] Create GitHub workflow for CI/CD
- [ ] Configure GitHub secrets for Firebase deployment
- [ ] Test the CI/CD pipeline

## Phase 3: GitHub Integration

### Step 1: Set Up GitHub Repository
- [ ] Create a new GitHub repository
- [ ] Push the codebase to GitHub
- [ ] Configure branch protection rules

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Actions
- [x] Set up GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- [ ] Configure environment variables and secrets
- [ ] Test the CI/CD pipeline

### Step 3: Documentation
- [x] Update README with GitHub integration instructions
- [ ] Create CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for contributors
- [ ] Document the CI/CD process

## Next Steps and Future Enhancements
